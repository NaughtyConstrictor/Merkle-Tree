    "> In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every \"leaf\" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. A hash tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure. A hash tree is a generalization of a hash list and a hash chain.  \n",

    "We will be using binary trees which means we will need to provide an implementation for the nodes first. The nodes can have either 0, 1 or 2 children, but one question that might arise is how de we deal with an odd number of leafs (or and odd number of branches). One way to deal with that is by duplicating the last node.  \n",
    "Thus we will make sure that the right child of a node (if not provided) will be the same as its left child.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Merkle tree nodes can be instanciated either by providing one or both of the children nodes; passed as keyword arguments only, or by providing the value of the node only.  \n",
    "I prefered it this way instead of passing `(hash(left) + hash(right), left, right)` to the constructor for ease of use and to avoid any unexpected errors, I think its better to let the implementation take care of adding the hashes of the children.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to keep all the values of a node's children just for inspection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding two hash values in this context means concatenating them, so one needs to be carful not to concatenate the hex representations of the hashes (using `hexdigest()` which returns the hex representation of the hash as a string) but instead use their bytes representation (using `digest()`).  \n",
    "We will be using SHA-256 hashing function by the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to make this class private since it is not meant to be instanciated by users, it is just a helper class for creating the tree, that is why I also chose to break the tradition of making a class's `__repr__` return a string which can be passed to `eval()` (or copied and executed on an interactive session) to recreate an instance, and instead make it return user friendly string representation of the instance. This would help later on, as you'll see, when displaying a list of nodes (since lists use an object's `__repr__` instead of `__str__`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've also added a `__eq__` method which would be useful later for comparing between trees (in unit testing)."
